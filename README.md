# Deep-Learning
The project I have worked on using below  topics:

* Mathematical Foundations of Gradient Descent and Backpropagation
* Optimization Algorithms
* Hyper-Parameter Tuning
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
* Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
